"""Suite-wide pytest configuration: source bootstrap + ledger isolation.

The ``sys.path`` inserts make ``apothem`` importable from a plain checkout
(no editable install) for every test subtree — unit, integration, property,
packaging, hooks, conformity, scripts — instead of only the two subtrees
that used to carry their own copy of the insert, and make the repo root
importable so the cross-subtree test helpers under ``tests/_shared/``
resolve as ``tests._shared`` namespace-package imports regardless of how
pytest is invoked. The autouse ledger isolation applies suite-wide for the
same reason: any subtree's test may exercise an install path, and none may
write a real ledger under the developer's home.
